# hello-world

Hi Lovely people!
My name is Maleeha. I am almost 17 (next month!). I am learning how to code. I know how to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as very basic Python. I want to learn how to use GitHub as it is what most developers use. I also want to use GitHub in order to create my own website using Netlify.

Wish me luck!
